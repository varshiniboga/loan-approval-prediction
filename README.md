Loan Approval Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the approval of loan applications based on various applicant features such as credit history, income, and other relevant attributes. This project leverages supervised learning techniques to streamline decision-making processes and minimize risks.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships in the dataset.

Model Training: Evaluating multiple machine learning models.

Prediction Interface: Input new data for predictions.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/varshiniboga/loan-approval-prediction.git
